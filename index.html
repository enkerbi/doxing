            Mongolian media space blew up on 16 May with the report on systemic
            corruption surrounding the State Educational Loan Fund. Based on the
            audit data in the report, the fund has been ridden with violations
            and corruption since 1997, when it started issuing loans to students
            pursuing higher education abroad. The list of all loan recipients,
            including their names and remaining loan amounts, was published on
            22 May, further exposing the scale of corruption and mounting
            pressure to pay back the loans. Independent investigation
            illustrates lack of transparency and competition in the allocation
            of loans. O.Batnairambal, who was the first one to bring this case
            to the public’s attention, to learn about the State Educational Loan
            Fund and the corruption surrounding it. Batnairamdal is a former
            Deputy Minister of Mining and Heavy Industry of Mongolia and the
            International Secretary of the ruling Mongolian People’s Party.
            Regarding the fund, it is not a scholarship fund, it is a loan fund.
            It was established in 1993 to provide financial support to students
            who lacked funds to cover their higher education costs at local
            universities. In 1997, the fund expanded to students who wanted to
            study abroad. It is still a mystery what are the criteria for
            receiving loans. The easiest criteria is for a bachelor’s degree.
            Students have to enroll into a top 100 global university. However,
            more than one third of all recipients got loans despite their
            universities not being in the top 100. Also, there are preferred
            majors as a criteria. If students got into a top 20 university it
            did not matter what major they pursued. If they got into
            universities ranked between 20 and 100, there were some preferred
            majors defined by the government, such as mining and engineering. Up
            until 2012, student loans were written off under the condition that
            recipients returned to Mongolia and worked for five years here. In
            2012, the government issued a decree, which changed this term.
            Everyone who received a loan after 2012 has to pay back their loan
            in full. It is 30 percent of the total amount issued for higher
            education. According to the current exchange rate, it is MNT 363
            billion (around USD 103 million). This amount was issued to 2,368
            students, pursuing undergraduate and graduate degrees from foreign
            universities. In 2021, the government adopted the Public Information
            Transparency Law as part of the initiative to fight corruption. This
            law allowed access to information, previously not available to the
            public. I used publicly available information and analyzed it to
            understand what has happened in the last 30 years and how the fund
            has been abused. The main finding of the two-month long
            investigation is that 90 percent of the loans were issued to high
            level officials, their children, and those who had access to closed
            information. There was no transparency or fair competition. The
            second finding is that the payback ratio is less than one percent.
            People always get confused and think that it is a scholarship fund.
            The 2011 Law on Higher Education and Social Security of Students
            states that it is an educational loan. People wrongly assume it is a
            scholarship. That is something I debunked in my report. The third
            finding is that 41 percent of the funds allocated to students
            pursuing master’s and doctoral degrees have been unlawfully written
            off by ministerial decrees since 2012. It is unlawful because
            article 8.8 of the law on higher education specifies that anything
            related to writing off loans issued through a specific fund can be
            regulated only by the parliament. All the ministerial decrees that
            wrote off loans are unlawful. It is not my personal conclusion, that
            is what the audit report by the state audit committee specified in
            their report.

            Former member of parliament B.Undarmaa was sentenced on Tuesday (11
            Aug) to two years and six months in prison for the abuse of power.
            B.Undarmaa was found guilty of abusing power to obtain a
            low-interest loan of MNT 700 million (USD 245,800) from a fund
            specifically for developing small and medium-sized enterprises.
            Mongolia has been intensifying its efforts against criminal cases
            related to abuse of power and corruption. Since the beginning of
            this year, the country has sentenced more than 20 high-ranking
            officials, including three former prime ministers – M.Enkhsaikhan,
            J.Erdenebat and S.Bayar — to prison. The 56-year-old served as a
            parliament member from 2016 to 2020.

            The trial of former PM S.Bayar and other six people started at the
            Ulaanbaatar’s Chingeltei Criminal Court today (15 June) at 09.00
            a.m. However, the trial was postponed to 18 June after lawyers and
            one of the defendants – former finance minister S.Bayartsogt –
            simply did not show up in the court because he was away election
            campaigning in Selenge province. Therefore, the court has issued a
            bail of MNT 5 billion to S.Bayartsogt and MNT 10 billion to S.Bayar.
            In other words, if two MPs failed to pay these very high bail fees,
            then they will be imprisoned. Former Prime Ministers S.Bayar and
            Ch.Saikhanbileg were arrested by the the Independent Authority
            against Corruption (IAAC) in 2018. The IAAC is investigating into
            possible abuse of power by certain government officials during the
            negotiations for the Oyu Tolgoi agreements, namely the Investment
            Agreement between the Government of Mongolia and Ivanhoe Mines
            Mongolia Inc LLC and Ivanhoe Mines Ltd and Rio Tinto International
            Holdings Limited, signed on October 6, 2009, and the Oyu Tolgoi
            Underground Mine Development and Financing Plan, signed on 18 May
            2015. Former Prime Ministers S.Bayar, who was in office in
            2007-2009, and Ch.Saikhanbileg, who led the Cabinet in 2014-2016,
            has thus been put under arrest in the course of the investigation.

            Chingiltei District Court has granted a request to extend
            imprisonment of B.Gankuyag, ex-chief executive of
            Erdenes-Tavantolgoi JSC, for a month. On 8 December, B.Gankhuyag and
            several associates as well as family members have been arrested and
            await trial, accused of embezzling billions of dollars in coal
            revenue. The anti-corruption department and the General Police
            Department conducted a joint enforcement operation and arrested
            several people. The arrests came after December protest over
            corruption in the country’s coal trade. Starting next month,
            Erdenes-Tavantolgoi JSC — the country’s largest state-owned coal
            miner — will cease signing direct sales contracts with buyers in
            neighbouring China, which last year purchased 84 percent of
            Mongolia’s total exports. Instead, the company’s coal will be
            auctioned on the Mongolian Stock Exchange.

            registration was denied. N.Enkhbayar was banned from standing for
            the presidential elections in 2017 because of the same reasons. He
            served as the country’s prime minister from 2000 to 2004, as speaker
            of the parliament from 2004 to 2005, and as the president of
            Mongolia from 2005 to 2009. Mongolia is expected to hold general
            elections on June 24.

            Transparency International and ARTICLE 19 today (30 April) called on
            the Mongolian government to take urgent legislative action to
            address an increasingly dangerous environment for the independent
            media in the country. In January, Article 13.14 of the Mongolian
            Criminal Code came into effect. This provision stipulates that
            disseminating false information can be punished by fines equivalent
            to approximately €300 – €900 Euros, 240 – 720 hours of community
            service, or restriction of the right to travel for one to three
            months. Mongolian press freedom and anti-corruption activists are
            concerned that the law does not define the term ‘false information’.
            In practice, they say, police, prosecutors and judges involved in
            criminal defamation cases are not considering the accuracy of
            information reported in the media or proving that it is false when
            charging people under the law. Article 13.14 should be urgently
            repealed, the organisations said. Previously in Mongolia, defamation
            cases were brought under Article 6.21 of the Law on Administrative
            Offences. In the first few months of this law coming into effect in
            late 2017, over 100 journalists were charged, many in cases brought
            by politicians. “Unfortunately, Mongolian public figures do not seem
            to accept that tolerance of criticism and accountability for their
            actions is part of the job,” said Ilham Mohammed, Asia Pacific
            regional advisor at Transparency International. “Previous defamation
            laws were widely used by politicians and business groups to silence
            critical voices, and now harsher, criminal legislation looks set to
            continue that trend with potentially dire consequences for
            independent media voices in Mongolia.” In addition, Mongolia’s 2017
            law on state and official secrets allows virtually all information
            to be classified as a state or official secret, leading in some
            cases to the prosecution of journalists exposing corruption. The
            country’s Law on Access to Information has not yet been fully
            implemented, almost a decade after being passed into law.

            Starting from February, Mongolia’s largest state-owned coal
            enterprises, Erdenes-Tavantolgoi JSC, will stop signing direct sales
            agreement with Chinese buyers. Instead, the company’s coal will be
            auctioned on the Mongolia Stock Exchange, which will increase
            transparency and ultimately bring higher returns to the country. The
            move to sell coal through the exchange comes in response to the
            protest against widespread fraud in the coal industry, where much of
            the theft was allegedly conducted by off-the-books coal sales with
            Chinese buyers at the border. Therefore, “Erdenes Tavantolgoi”
            company is planning to launch online trading of coal on the exchange
            between 8-10 February. Therefore, a tender for transportation of
            coal from mine to the border has been announced. It is expected that
            over 200 companies will participated in the tender. There are 55
            Chinese companies which expressing their willingness to buy coal
            through the exchange, according to Special Representative of the
            Government in “Erdenes Tavantolgoi” J.Ganbat. Earlier this month,
            the stock exchange organized a trial run trade to test the new
            system — 12,800 tonnes of coking coal was auctioned to a
            Singapore-based coal transporter. The final call price had increased
            12.2 percent above the original asking price, from 1,150 yuan/tonnes
            to 1,290 yuan/tonnes. The company is planning to sell about 200,000
            tons of coal on the exchange in the first phase. “Erdenes
            Tavantolgoi” JSC plans to export 23 million tons of coal this year.
            The Mongolian government promised to end years of shady coal deals
            after people staged a massive anti-corruption protest in Ulaanbaatar
            last December. The company’s CEO B.Gankhuyag and several associates
            as well as family members have been arrested and face trial on
            charges of embezzling billions of dollars in coal revenue. Mongolia
            is one of key significant coal suppliers for China, especially for
            coking coal used for steel making. Mongolia’s coal exports came in
            at 31.69 million tonnes in 2022, surging 101.72 percent or 15.98
            million tonnes year on year, showed data from the Mongolian Customs
            General Administration. A total of 29.77 million tonnes were
            exported to China, soaring 104.50 percent year on year, representing
            94 percent of the total.

            Mongolians are firmly protesting against a “coal mafia”, led by
            ex-President Kh.Battulga who have apparently robbed the public purse
            of billions of dollars. The government investigation committee is
            considering about 1 million tonnes of coal may have been released
            without registration. During the investigation, it was revealed that
            207,000 tons of coal exported to China without Mongolian customs
            registration between 20 May and 20 June, 2017, inspectors at the
            time determined that 3,758 coal haul trucks were registered as
            “empty” at customs.

            Sh.Batkhuu, former director of the ‘Just Group’ was sentenced on 22
            October to eight years in prison and ordered to pay MNT 140 billion
            to compensate the government after years of investigation and court
            delays. However, the Khan-Uul District Court dismissed charges
            against five others involved in the notorious case of South African
            Standard Bank. Back in 2013, Mongolia’s anti-corruption agency begin
            investigating Sh.Batkhuu in connection to his offering up the
            Erdenet Mining Corporation as collateral for USD 110 million loans
            obtained from the South African Standard Bank. The case began to be
            heavily publicised after the London Court of International
            Arbitration ruled in favour of the South African Standard Bank.
            According to Deputy PM U.Enkhtuvshin, the Mongolian Government has

        <h2>How to become a politician</h2>
        <br />
        <p>
          Becoming a politician in Mongolia involves engaging with the political
          system, gaining community support, and working within established
          political structures. <br />
          Here's a step-by-step guide tailored to Mongolia's political
          framework:
          <br />1. Understand Mongolia's Political System Governance Structure:
          Mongolia is a parliamentary republic. The Great State Khural
          (Parliament) is the highest legislative body, with the Prime Minister
          as the head of government and the President serving as the head of
          state. Political Parties: Major parties include the Mongolian People's
          Party (MPP), the Democratic Party (DP), and smaller parties and
          coalitions. Election System: Parliamentary and local elections operate

          An offshore account is a bank account held in a financial institution
          located outside the account holder’s home country. These accounts are
          often used for legitimate purposes, such as international business,
          wealth management, or diversifying investments. However, they have
          also been associated with tax evasion and illegal activities when
          misused. Key Features of Offshore Accounts Foreign Location: The
          account is in a country different from where the account holder
          resides. Privacy: Some offshore jurisdictions offer higher levels of
          privacy for account holders. Currency Flexibility: Offshore accounts
          often allow transactions in multiple currencies. Tax Benefits: Certain
          jurisdictions provide favorable tax rates or exemptions. Reasons for
          Opening an Offshore Account Asset Protection: Shielding assets from
          political or economic instability in the home country. International
          Business: Facilitating global trade and transactions in different
          currencies. Tax Planning: Legally reducing tax liability by taking
          advantage of low-tax jurisdictions. Investment Opportunities:
          Accessing international investment markets not available in the home
          country. Confidentiality: Maintaining privacy, especially in
          jurisdictions with strict banking secrecy laws. Common Offshore
          Jurisdictions Caribbean: Cayman Islands, Bermuda, Bahamas. Europe:
          Switzerland, Luxembourg, Monaco. Asia: Singapore, Hong Kong. Others:
          Panama, Seychelles. Legal Considerations Reporting Obligations: Many
          countries, like the U.S., require citizens to report foreign accounts
          to prevent tax evasion. Transparency: International agreements like
          the Common Reporting Standard (CRS) and the Foreign Account Tax
          Compliance Act (FATCA) aim to increase transparency of offshore
          accounts. Legality: Holding an offshore account is legal if used
          properly and declared to tax authorities. Misuse of Offshore Accounts
          Offshore accounts can be used improperly for: Tax Evasion: Hiding
          income or assets from tax authorities. Money Laundering: Concealing
          illegally obtained money. Fraud: Evading financial regulations or
          obligations. To ensure compliance, it is important to consult legal
          and financial experts when considering an offshore account.
